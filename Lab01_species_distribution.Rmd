# Overview

This machine learning analysis was completed as an assignment for my Masterâ€™s program course, Environmental Data Science 232: Machine Learning. It was assigned by our professor, Dr. Ben Best, as an introduction to machine learning by predicting presence of a chosen species from observations and environmental data found on the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility site](https://www.gbif.org/). It follows guidance found at [Species distribution modeling | R Spatial ](https://rspatial.org/raster/sdm/).

My chosen species is coyote brush (*Baccharis pilularis*). **Baccharis pilularis** is native to the west coast of the United States (Oregon, California, and Baja California, Mexico). It is a shurb in the Asteraceae (Sunflower) family with oblanceolate to obovate toothed leaves, panicle-like inflorescence with staminate flowers that when mature mimic snow, and generally sticky (*not a pun*) [@jepson:bp].

# Explore

The first step in this machine learning exercise is to download observation data of *Baccharis pilularis* from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility site](https://www.gbif.org/).

### Aquire species observations 
```{r get obs}
obs_csv <- file.path(dir_data, "obs.csv")
obs_geo <- file.path(dir_data, "obs.geojson")

```

```{r}
if (!file.exists(obs_geo) | redo){
  # get species occurrence data from GBIF with coordinates
  (res <- spocc::occ(
    query = 'Baccharis pilularis', 
    from = 'gbif', 
    has_coords = T,
    limit = 10000))
  
  # extract data frame from result
  df <- res$gbif$data[[1]] 
  readr::write_csv(df, obs_csv)
  
  # convert to points of observation from lon/lat columns in data frame
  obs <- df %>% 
    sf::st_as_sf(
      coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
      crs = st_crs(4326)) %>% 
    select(prov, key) # save space (joinable from obs_csv)
  sf::write_sf(obs, obs_geo, delete_dsn=T)
}
obs <- sf::read_sf(obs_geo)
nrow(obs) # number of rows
 
```

```{r}
# show points on map
mapview::mapview(obs, map.types = "CartoDB.Voyager")
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
obs$key <- as.factor(obs$key)

# count number of observations
obs_num <- nrow(obs)

# Check for duplicates - creates a vector of T or F for each of the points ???should you use 'key' vs 'geom'???
dups <- duplicated(obs$key)

# how many duplicates were there? This will sum only the TRUE values
sum(dups)

# create lon and lat columns in preparation to clean inaccurate data points

obs <- obs %>%
  dplyr::mutate(lon = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,1],
                lat = sf::st_coordinates(.)[,2])

usa <- gadm_sf_loadCountries("USA", level = 2, basefile = "data/")
```

- **Question 1**. How many observations total are in GBIF for your species?

There are `r obs_num`` observations for *Baccharis pilularis* in this data. According to the [iNaturalist site](https://www.inaturalist.org/), over 19,000 observations have been uploaded of this species.

- **Question 2**.  Do you see any odd observations, like marine species on land or vice versa? 

There were only a few observably inaccurate data points for this species. These points seemingly fall in the ocean along the coastline. I chose not to remove these points as there may be inaccuracies on the basemap chosen and these points may actually be on land. I also did not want to lose potential valuable environmental data.

### Aquire environmental data 

The next step is to use the Species Distribution Model predictors R package `sdmpredictors` to get underlying environmental data for *Baccharis pilularis* observations. 

##### Environmental data

```{r get env}
dir_env <- file.path(dir_data, "env")

# set a default data directory
options(sdmpredictors_datadir = dir_env)

# choosing terrestrial
env_datasets <- sdmpredictors::list_datasets(terrestrial = TRUE, marine = FALSE)

# show table of datasets
env_datasets %>% 
  select(dataset_code, description, citation) %>% 
  DT::datatable()

# choose datasets for a vector
env_datasets_vec <- c("WorldClim", "ENVIREM")

# get layers
env_layers <- sdmpredictors::list_layers(env_datasets_vec)
DT::datatable(env_layers)

# choose layers after some inspection and perhaps consulting literature
env_layers_vec <- c("WC_alt", "WC_bio1", "WC_bio6", "WC_bio12", "ER_PETseasonality", "ER_topoWet", "ER_climaticMoistureIndex")

# get layers
env_stack <- load_layers(env_layers_vec)

# interactive plot layers, hiding all but first (select others)
# mapview(env_stack, hide = T) # makes the html too big for Github
plot(env_stack, nc=2)
```

- **Question 3**. What environmental layers did you choose as predictors? Can you find any support for these in the literature?

- *WC_alt = altitude*. This was chosen due to the limited elevation range listed on the CalFlora site, which states that coyote brush has been documented between -3 to 2310 meters (CalFlora 2021). <br>
- *WC_bio1 = annual mean temperature.*  This is a fundamental environmental indicator so it has been included.<br>
- *WC_bio6 = minimum temperature of the coldest month* *Baccharis pilularis* is a distributed throughout the California Floristic Province, which is a mediterranean climate (Calsbeek 2003). This climatic region does not have prolonged freezing temperatures, so I am interested in analyzing the influence of minimum cold temperature on the habitat range of coyote brush. <br>
- *WC_bio12 = annual precipitation*  <br>
- *ER_PETseasonality = monthly variability in potential evapotranspiration* Coyote brush uptakes fog water, so I am curious to analyze if evapotranspiration rates influences its distribution (Emery 2018). I anticipate that areas with higher rates of evapotranspiration are not as suitable for *B. pilularis*. <br>
- *ER_topoWet = topographic wetness index* this is a proxy for soil wetness, and can characterize biological processes such as annual net primary production, vegetation patterns, and forest site quality. Coyote brush is found from wetlands to chaparral. I am interested to see if soil moisture influences the location of coyote brush. <br>
- *ER_climaticMoistureIndex = climatic moisture index*. This is a metric of relative wetness and aridity. It is calculated as the difference between annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (Vorosmarty 2005).  

##### Region of Interest
The environmental data is on a global scale. Here we crop the environmental rasters to a region of interest around the distribution of *Baccharis pilularis*.

```{r clip env_raster}
obs_hull_geo  <- file.path(dir_data, "obs_hull.geojson")
env_stack_grd <- file.path(dir_data, "env_stack.grd")

if (!file.exists(obs_hull_geo) | redo){
  # make convex hull around points of observation
  obs_hull <- sf::st_convex_hull(st_union(obs))
  
  # save obs hull
  write_sf(obs_hull, obs_hull_geo)
}
obs_hull <- read_sf(obs_hull_geo)

# show points on map
mapview(
  list(obs, obs_hull))

```

```{r}
if (!file.exists(env_stack_grd) | redo){
  obs_hull_sp <- sf::as_Spatial(obs_hull)
  env_stack <- raster::mask(env_stack, obs_hull_sp) %>% 
    raster::crop(extent(obs_hull_sp))
  writeRaster(env_stack, env_stack_grd, overwrite = T)  
}
env_stack <- stack(env_stack_grd)

# show map
# mapview(obs) + 
#   mapview(env_stack, hide = T) # makes html too big for Github
plot(env_stack, nc=2)
```

#### Pseudo-Absence

```{r make absence pts}

absence_geo <- file.path(dir_data, "absence.geojson")
pts_geo     <- file.path(dir_data, "pts.geojson")
pts_env_csv <- file.path(dir_data, "pts_env.csv")

if (!file.exists(absence_geo) | redo){
  # get raster count of observations
  r_obs <- rasterize(
    sf::as_Spatial(obs), env_stack[[1]], field=1, fun='count')
  
  # create mask for 
  r_mask <- mask(env_stack[[1]] > -Inf, r_obs, inverse=T)
  
  # generate random points inside mask
  absence <- dismo::randomPoints(r_mask, nrow(obs)) %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326)
  
  write_sf(absence, absence_geo, delete_dsn=T)
}
absence <- read_sf(absence_geo)

# show map of presence, ie obs, and absence
mapview(absence, col.regions = "gray") +
  mapview(obs, col.regions = "green")

```

```{r}

if (!file.exists(pts_env_csv) | redo){

  # combine presence and absence into single set of labeled points 
  pts <- rbind(
    obs %>% 
      mutate(
        present = 1) %>% 
      select(present, key),
    absence %>% 
      mutate(
        present = 0,
        key     = NA)) %>% 
    mutate(
      ID = 1:n()) %>% 
    relocate(ID)
  write_sf(pts, pts_geo, delete_dsn=T)

  # extract raster values for points
  pts_env <- raster::extract(env_stack, as_Spatial(pts), df=TRUE) %>% 
    tibble() %>% 
    # join present and geometry columns to raster value results for points
    left_join(
      pts %>% 
        select(ID, present),
      by = "ID") %>% 
    relocate(present, .after = ID) %>% 
    # extract lon, lat as single columns
    mutate(
      #present = factor(present),
      lon = st_coordinates(geometry)[,1],
      lat = st_coordinates(geometry)[,2]) %>% 
    select(-geometry)
  write_csv(pts_env, pts_env_csv)
}
pts_env <- read_csv(pts_env_csv)

pts_env %>% 
  # show first 10 presence, last 10 absence
  slice(c(1:10, (nrow(pts_env)-9):nrow(pts_env))) %>% 
  DT::datatable(
    rownames = F,
    options = list(
      dom = "t",
      pageLength = 20))
```

In the end this table is the **data** that feeds into our species distribution model (`y ~ X`), where:

- `y` is the `present` column with values of `1` (present) or `0` (absent)
- `X` is all other columns:  `r paste(setdiff(names(pts_env), c("present", "ID")), collapse = ", ")`

## Term Plots

In the vein of [exploratory data analyses](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html), before going into modeling let's look at the data. Specifically, let's look at how obviously differentiated is the presence versus absence for each predictor -- a more pronounced presence peak should make for a more confident model. A plot for a specific predictor and response is called a "term plot". In this case we'll look for predictors where the presence (present = `1`) occupies a distinct "niche" from the background absence points (present = `0`).

```{r plot terms}
pts_env %>% 
  select(-ID) %>% 
  mutate(
    present = factor(present)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-present) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(x = value, fill = present)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("gray", "green"), 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Baccharis pilularis Term Plots") +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(1, 0),
    legend.justification = c(1, 0))
```

# Section B: Explore (cont'd)

#### Pairs Plot
Show correlations between variables. 

```{r}
pts_env <- read_csv(pts_env_csv)
nrow(pts_env)

datatable(pts_env, rownames = F)
```

```{r ggpairs, fig.cap="Pairs plot with `present` color coded.", fig.width=11, fig.height=11, eval=T, warning=FALSE}
GGally::ggpairs(
  select(pts_env, -ID),
  aes(color = factor(present), alpha = 0.5))

```

# Logistic Regression

## Setup Data

Let's setup a data frame with only the data we want to model by:

- Dropping rows with any NAs. Later we'll learn how to ["impute"](https://bbest.github.io/eds232-ml/glossary.html#imputation) values with guesses so as to not throw away data.
- Removing terms we don't want to model. We can then use a simplified formula $present \sim .$ to predict $present$ based on all other fields in the data frame (i.e. the $X$`s in $y \sim x_1 + x_2 + ... x_n$).

```{r setup d}
# setup model data
d <- pts_env %>% 
  select(-ID) %>%  # remove terms we don't want to model
  tidyr::drop_na() # drop the rows with NA values
nrow(d)
```

## Linear Model

Let's start as simply as possible with a linear model `lm()` on multiple predictors `X` to predict presence `y` using a simpler workflow.

```{r fig.cap="Simpler workflow with only fit and predict of all data, i.e. no splitting.", echo=F}
# [model-workflow_fit-all-predict-all - Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JtWF-4dltWR0hSAZBGaqQdLShReLVjLhKZG8iRpVY2A/edit)
knitr::include_graphics("https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRRvQdrDELT9QRPJxj8ooPvABgjQ-qqjzC0Ri9Hhv6n1O7N31eb4o6c7ZhZd6QtQ7XgZybNhUBESK9L/pub?w=572&h=170")
```

```{r fit lm}
# fit a linear model
mdl <- lm(present ~ ., data = d)
summary(mdl)

y_predict <- predict(mdl, d, type="response")
y_true    <- d$present

```

```{r}
range(y_predict)
```

```{r}
range(y_true)
```

The problem with these predictions is that it ranges outside the possible values of present `1` and absent `0`. (Later we'll deal with converting values within this range to either `1` or `0` by applying a cutoff value; i.e. any values > 0.5 become 1 and below become 0.)

## Generalized Linear Model

To solve this problem of constraining the response term to being between the two possible values, i.e. the **probability** $p$ of being one or the other possible $y$ values, we'll apply the logistic transformation on the response term.

$$
logit(p_i) = \log_{e}\left( \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right)
$$

We can expand the expansion of the predicted term, i.e. the probability $p$ of being either $y$, with all possible predictors $X$ whereby each coeefficient $b$ gets multiplied by the value of $x$:

$$
\log_{e}\left( \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \right) = b_0 + b_1 x_{1,i} + b_2 x_{2,i} + \cdots + b_k x_{k,i}
$$

```{r fit glm}
# fit a generalized linear model with a binomial logit link function
mdl <- glm(present ~ ., family = binomial(link="logit"), data = d)
summary(mdl)

y_predict <- predict(mdl, d, type="response")

range(y_predict)
```

Excellent, our response is now constrained between 0 and 1. Next, let's look at the term plots to see the relationship between predictor and response.

```{r termplots glm}
# show term plots
termplot(mdl, partial.resid = TRUE, se = TRUE, main = F, ylim="free")
```

## Generalized Additive Model

With a generalized additive model we can add "wiggle" to the relationship between predictor and response by introducing smooth `s()` terms.

```{r fit gam}
librarian::shelf(mgcv)

# fit a generalized additive model with smooth predictors
mdl <- mgcv::gam(
  formula = present ~ s(WC_alt) + s(WC_bio1) + s(WC_bio6) + s(WC_bio12) + 
    s(ER_PETseasonality) + s(ER_topoWet) + s(ER_climaticMoistureIndex) + s(lon) + s(lat),
  family = binomial, data = d)
summary(mdl)

# show term plots
plot(mdl, scale=0)
```

**Question:** Which GAM environmental variables, and even range of values, seem to contribute most towards presence (above 0 response) versus absence (below 0 response)?

The variables most likely to contribute to presence from the 7 I chose originally are ER_topoWet and ER-climaticMoistureIndex. For ER-climaticMoistureIndex, the higher the index number, specifically above 0, the higher likelihood of coyote brush presence. ER_topoWet is less conclusive as the higher likelihood of presence is in the value range less than 8, but there is a wide confidence interval. 

## Maxent (Maximum Entropy)

Maxent is probably the most commonly used species distribution model ([Elith 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00725.x)) since it performs well with few input data points, only requires presence points (and samples background for comparison) and is easy to use with a Java graphical user interface (GUI).

```{r fit maxent}
# load extra packages
librarian::shelf(
  maptools, sf)

mdl_maxent_rds <- file.path(dir_data, "mdl_maxent.rds")

# show version of maxent
if (!interactive())
  maxent()

```

```{r}
# get environmental rasters
# NOTE: the first part of Lab 1. SDM - Explore got updated to write this clipped environmental raster stack
env_stack_grd <- file.path(dir_data, "env_stack.grd")
env_stack <- stack(env_stack_grd)
plot(env_stack, nc=2)
```

```{r}
# get presence-only observation points (maxent extracts raster values for you)
obs_geo <- file.path(dir_data, "obs.geojson")
obs_sp <- read_sf(obs_geo) %>% 
  sf::as_Spatial() # maxent prefers sp::SpatialPoints over newer sf::sf class

# fit a maximum entropy model
if (!file.exists(mdl_maxent_rds) | redo){
  mdl <- maxent(env_stack, obs_sp)
  readr::write_rds(mdl, mdl_maxent_rds)
}
mdl <- read_rds(mdl_maxent_rds)

# plot variable contributions per predictor
plot(mdl)
```

```{r}
# plot term plots
response(mdl)
```

**Question:** Which Maxent environmental variables, and even range of values, seem to contribute most towards presence (closer to 1 response) and how might this differ from the GAM results?

Altitude and ER_climaticVariableMoisture variables contribute the most towards presence of coyote brush. The ER_climaticVariableMoisture was one of the main predicators in the GAM model. As for why altitude was not as obviously a primary presence predictor is potentially due to the scale of the GAM plot. It was difficult to intepret the presence weight on the WC_alt GAM plot as the elevation range on the x-axis was more extensive than other variable x-axes. 

```{r}
# predict
y_predict <- predict(env_stack, mdl) #, ext=ext, progress='')

plot(y_predict, main='Maxent, raw prediction')
data(wrld_simpl, package="maptools")
plot(wrld_simpl, add=TRUE, border='dark grey')
```

  na.omit()                         # drop rows with NA

```

## Split data into training and testing

# fit a default random forest model

# get out of the box RMSE
(default_rmse <- sqrt(mdl_rf$prediction.error))
```

## Feature interpretation

```{r feature-importance}
# re-run model with impurity-based variable importance
mdl_impurity <- ranger(
  present ~ ., data = d_train,
  importance = "impurity")

# re-run model with permutation-based variable importance
mdl_permutation <- ranger(
  present ~ ., data = d_train,
  importance = "permutation")
```

```{r feature-importance-plot, fig.cap="Most important variables based on impurity (left) and permutation (right).", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=10}
p1 <- vip::vip(mdl_impurity, bar = FALSE)
p2 <- vip::vip(mdl_permutation, bar = FALSE)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

**Question:** How might variable importance differ between rpart and RandomForest in your model outputs?
RandomForest it creates a "forest" of decision trees where r part creates a single decision tree. RandomForest reduces model variance, which has changed the importance of environmental variables predicting presence of coyote brush. The most important varible with RandomForest is WC_bio6.

**Question:** Which variables were removed due to multicollinearity and what is the rank of most to least important remaining variables in your model?

WC_bio1, WC_bio6, ER_climaticMoistureIndex were removed. For the environmental variable ranking of most to least important variable for species presence is:<br>
- ER_PETseasonality
- WC_alt
- WC_bio12
- ER_topoWet  

```{r}
# predict
y_maxv <- predict(env_stack, mdl_maxv) #, ext=ext, progress='')

plot(y_maxv, main='Maxent, raw prediction')
data(wrld_simpl, package="maptools")
plot(wrld_simpl, add=TRUE, border='dark grey')
```
